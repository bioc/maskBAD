  abstract =	 {{MOTIVATION}: When comparing gene expression levels
                  between species or strains using microarrays,
                  sequence differences between the groups can cause
                  false identification of expression differences. Our
                  simulated dataset shows that a sequence divergence
                  of only 1\% between species can lead to falsely
                  reported expression differences for >50\% of the
                  transcripts-similar levels of effect have been
                  reported previously in comparisons of human and
                  chimpanzee expression. We propose a method for
                  identifying probes that cause such false readings,
                  using only the microarray data, so that problematic
                  probes can be excluded from analysis. We then test
                  the power of the method to detect sequence
                  differences and to correct for falsely reported
                  expression differences. Our method can detect 70\%
                  of the probes with sequence differences using human
                  and chimpanzee data, while removing only 18\% of
                  probes with no sequence differences. Although only
                  70\% of the probes with sequence differences are
                  detected, the effect of removing probes on falsely
                  reported expression differences is more dramatic:
                  the method can remove 98\% of the falsely reported
                  expression differences from a simulated dataset. We
                  argue that the method should be used even when
                  sequence data are available. {CONTACT}:

@article{Khaitovich04,
  abstract =	 {We have analyzed gene expression in various brain
                  regions of humans and chimpanzees. Within both human
                  and chimpanzee individuals, the transcriptomes of
                  the cerebral cortex are very similar to each other
                  and differ more between individuals than among
                  regions within an individual. In contrast, the
                  transcriptomes of the cerebral cortex, the caudate
                  nucleus, and the cerebellum differ substantially
                  from each other. Between humans and chimpanzees,
                  10\% of genes differ in their expression in at least
                  one region of the brain. The majority of these
                  expression differences are shared among all brain
                  regions. Whereas genes encoding proteins involved in
                  signal transduction and cell differentiation differ
                  significantly between brain regions within
                  individuals, no such pattern is seen between the
                  species. However, a subset of genes that show
                  expression differences between humans and
                  chimpanzees are distributed nonrandomly across the
                  genome. Furthermore, genes that show an elevated
                  expression level in humans are statistically
                  significantly enriched in regions that are recently
                  duplicated in humans.},
